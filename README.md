===============

Clone this repo and create a responsive image gallery using the gallery.json file for data. Include and/or create what ever other resources you may need then submit a pull request. 

Make sure to document your decision process in your code and elaborate on challenges and solutions in your commit messages and pull requests.

Keep in mind, this is more about problem solving rather than strictly skill with code. Highlight areas you are strong in, but don't sweat any weaker areas too much.


Notes on the Ryan Sheffer Gallery Submission:

A couple of changes that I made: 

That may not be fully tracked in the code. 

1. I standardized the images height and widths, and reduced their size for web. 

2. I am iterating over the JSON code, and then am injecting that code into the webpage with the dynmic info from the JSON file. This work is being done in gallery.js

3. The BootStrap template is not mine -- I just modified it. You can read the "READMECreatitiveTheme.md" for the credits. 

4. I striped out the images html code in index.html and build theme dynamically in the javascript file gallery.js

5. There were four "At Your Service" categories. I took out one, and used to bootstrap grid classess to center them on the large screen.

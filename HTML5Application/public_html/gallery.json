Aside from the obvious problem of the band's ears being feline in nature and foxes being of the canine varity, there is also the anachronistic problems, Josie predating this young fox by several decades... Just shameful!",

When questioned about the diminutive punishment, the H.R. rep stated unapologetically, 'birds will be birds.' Of no comfort to the passing female as this was the thrid time this week she had been whistled at in a tone denoting that the male is available for mating",
